# Blob URL Image Loading Fix

## The Problem
The error you're seeing:
```
❌ Image failed to load: http://localhost:5000/blob:http://localhost:5173/7d16578c-69ee-44e2-8cce-f7c5a7f3edc4
```

This happens because:
1. **Blob URLs** are temporary local URLs created by `URL.createObjectURL()` for file previews
2. **These URLs are being processed** through the API base URL, creating invalid URLs
3. **Blob URLs should not be sent to the server** - they're only for local preview

## Root Cause
- New file uploads create blob URLs for immediate preview
- These blob URLs get stored in the `existingImages` array
- When displaying images in peer groups, blob URLs are processed as if they were server URLs
- This creates invalid URLs like `http://localhost:5000/blob:http://localhost:5173/...`

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Enhanced Image URL Handling** (`imageUtils.js`)
- Added proper blob URL detection and handling
- Blob URLs are now passed through unchanged (not processed through API base)
- Prevents invalid URL construction

### 2. **Filtered Blob URLs from Peer Groups** (`AccomplishmentReport.jsx`)
- Added filter to exclude blob URLs from peer groups display
- Only shows server-uploaded images in peer groups
- Blob URLs are only used for local previews

### 3. **Improved Server Response Handling**
- Backend now returns proper image URLs after upload
- Frontend uses server URLs instead of blob URLs after successful upload
- Fallback to blob URLs only if server doesn't return proper URLs

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- Enhanced debug logging to identify URL construction issues
- Clearer error messages for troubleshooting

## Files Updated

1. **`src/utils/imageUtils.js`**
   - Added blob URL detection and proper handling
   - Prevents blob URLs from being processed through API base

2. **`src/pages/Teacher/AccomplishmentReport.jsx`**
   - Added blob URL filtering for peer groups display
   - Improved server response handling for uploads
   - Better error handling and debugging

3. **`CAPSTONE_API_DATABASE/controllers/submissionController.js`**
   - Backend now returns image URLs in response
   - Proper image URL construction for server-stored files

## How It Works Now

### Before (Broken):
1. User uploads file → Creates blob URL for preview
2. Blob URL gets stored in `existingImages`
3. Peer groups try to display blob URL through API base
4. Creates invalid URL: `http://localhost:5000/blob:http://localhost:5173/...`
5. Image fails to load

### After (Fixed):
1. User uploads file → Creates blob URL for preview
2. File gets uploaded to server → Server returns proper URL
3. Frontend replaces blob URL with server URL
4. Peer groups filter out any remaining blob URLs
5. Only server URLs are displayed in peer groups
6. Images load correctly

## Testing the Fix

1. **Upload a new image** through your application
2. **Check browser console** - should see no more blob URL errors
3. **Verify images appear** in both the form and peer groups
4. **Check Network tab** - should see proper server URLs, not blob URLs

## Deployment Steps

1. **Upload the updated files** to your VPS:
   - `src/utils/imageUtils.js`
   - `src/pages/Teacher/AccomplishmentReport.jsx`
   - `CAPSTONE_API_DATABASE/controllers/submissionController.js`

2. **Restart your backend server**:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart capstone-api
   ```

3. **Clear browser cache** and test image uploads

## Expected Results

- ✅ No more blob URL errors in console
- ✅ Images load correctly in peer groups
- ✅ New uploads work properly
- ✅ Existing images continue to work
- ✅ No more invalid URL construction

The fix ensures that blob URLs are only used for local previews and never sent to the server or displayed in peer groups, while server URLs are properly constructed and displayed.
