# Blob URL Fix - Testing Guide

## What We Fixed

### 1. **Enhanced Image URL Handling** (`imageUtils.js`)
- Added proper blob URL detection
- Blob URLs are now handled correctly without being processed through API base

### 2. **Filtered Blob URLs from Display** (`AccomplishmentReport.jsx`)
- Added filtering to exclude blob URLs from image display
- Fixed React key uniqueness issues
- Added cleanup function to remove blob URLs

### 3. **Improved Error Handling**
- Better URL construction for all image types
- Proper fallback handling

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Restart Your Development Server
```bash
# Stop your current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Right-click the refresh button
- Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Step 3: Test Image Upload
1. **Go to Accomplishment Report page**
2. **Upload a new image**
3. **Check browser console** - should see NO blob URL errors
4. **Verify image displays correctly**

### Step 4: What to Look For

**✅ SUCCESS - You should see:**
- No `❌ GET blob:http://localhost:5173/... net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` errors
- No "Encountered two children with the same key" warnings
- Images display correctly in the form
- No console errors related to blob URLs

**❌ FAILURE - If you still see:**
- Blob URL errors in console
- React key warnings
- Images not loading

## If Issues Persist

### Check These Files Are Updated:
1. `src/utils/imageUtils.js` - Should have blob URL handling
2. `src/pages/Teacher/AccomplishmentReport.jsx` - Should have blob URL filtering
3. `CAPSTONE_API_DATABASE/controllers/submissionController.js` - Should return image URLs

### Debug Steps:
1. **Check console for specific errors**
2. **Verify file updates were applied**
3. **Clear browser cache completely**
4. **Restart development server**

## Expected Console Output

**Before Fix:**
```
❌ GET blob:http://localhost:5173/7d16578c-69ee-44e2-8cce-f7c5a7f3edc4 net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `blob:http://localhost:5173/...`
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ No blob URL errors
✅ No React key warnings
✅ Images load correctly
```

## Next Steps

Once localhost testing is successful:
1. **Deploy to VPS** with the same files
2. **Test on live site** - should work identically
3. **Verify no console errors** on production

The fix ensures blob URLs are handled properly in both development and production environments.
